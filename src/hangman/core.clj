;;;; STEP 1: game state

;; NOTE: You may be tempted to use (def ) to redefine symbol, in
;;       order to emulate state change. Do not do this, as def should
;;       be used only for the "development".

;; Mutating state is handled by refs, vars and atoms.
;; In this tutorial, we will use atoms.

(comment

  ;; define atom
  (def foo (atom 3))

  ;; obtain atoms value
  @foo

  ;; change atoms state
  (swap! foo inc)

  ;; obtain atoms value again
  @foo

  )

;; game state is stored in this var
(def current-game (atom (game/create-game)))

  [game]
  (when (game/game-over? game)
    (when (game/won? game)
      (stats/update_wins))
    (stats/update_games)))

;;;; Public API

(defn get-game-info
  "Returns current game info."
  []

  "Adds new guess to the game, but only if game is not over.
  Returns info for player."

  (get-game-info))

;; NOTE: Function name should end with bang (!), if it does change
;;       some state, calls modyfying io or performs side-effects.
