(comment

  ;; a word
  "hangman"

  ;; word converted to seq of chars
  (seq "hangman")

  ;; go through the word and check if characters are equal
  (map #(= % \a) "hangman")

  ;; we can use set to check for equality
  (map #{\a} "hangman")

  ;; we can put more chars into set
  (map #{\a \h \c} "hangman")
